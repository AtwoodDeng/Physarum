This is a Unity Demo for the Physarum Simulation. Inspired by [Sage Jenson's Procedural Art](https://sagejenson.com/physarum), this project implemented the [evolution of Physarum networks](http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/15260/1/artl.2010.16.2.pdf) by using some CG techniques including compute shader, GPU particles and 3D volume visulazation. A brief introduction will be presented as below.
